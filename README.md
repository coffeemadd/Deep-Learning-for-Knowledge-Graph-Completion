# Deep-Learning-for-Knowledge-Graph-Completion


Below is a list of the contents of the repository. Please update when you commit.
###  data/ ~ Contains all the data we've built for this project. 
		EncodedData.csv:		The Main data, already encoded with entity embeddings, and 
						associated outputs. Of the form 
						[EntityA|EntityB|a0,a1,...,a299|b0,b1,...,b299|p0,p1,p2,p3,p4]
						where EntityA/B are the names of the entities, ai/bi are the 
						embeddings for these entities, and pi is the predicate for this
						entity-entity pair. Predicates follow {1: True, 0: Unknown, -1: False}.
		Build_Data.py:	  		The Python script used to generate EncodedData.csv
		Build_Data.ipynb: 		A Jupyter Notebook for the Build_Data.py script

###		data/raw/ ~ A directory containing the raw exported knowledge graph
		SparqlQuery.txt:		The query used to pull the data from WikiData
		wikiData.txt:			The result of the above query on WikiData
		wikiData.csv:			Same as wikiData.txt but in .csv format
		wikiData.py:			A python script used to generate much of processed/

### 	data/embeddings/ ~ A directory of word/entity embeddings and their scripts
		entity_embeddings.pkl:  	A dictionary of entity embeddings
		word_vectors.pkl:		A dictionary of word embeddings
		word_embeddings.py:		Script for generating word_vectors.pkl
		bad_entities.py:		A list of entities with no encoding 

###		data/processed/ ~ A directory of processed versions of the data in raw/
		entities_map.pkl:		A dictionary that maps entity labels to their full names
		entities.txt:			A list of all the entities' full names
		positiveTriplets: 		The list of true statements for entity-entity pairs
		negativeTriplets:		A list of some false statements for entity-entity pairs
		predicates.txt: 		A list of the 5 predicates used for this project
		unique.txt: 			A list of the unique elements of vocab.txt
		vocab.txt: 			All words used throughout the entities.txt file

### 	TeX/ ~ A directory containing the TeX for our report
		Project.TeX:  			The main TeX document. I have a standard pre-amble I've been building 
						over the years, so please excuse how huge it is. I have to say that a lot
		bib.bib:			The bibliography file. There are some examples already written if you need

### 	MLP/ ~ A directory containing the code for the MLP model
		MLP.ipynb:  			A Jupyter Notebook for building the MLP model (not functional yet)
		RunMLP.r:				Running MLP on R using RSNNS package
		MLP.rda:				The stored data (like .pkl) for runMLP. Not needed to use the script
